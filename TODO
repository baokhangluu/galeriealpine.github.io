Priority:

- Complete Association page copy
- Atelier page needs to be its own and not redirect to blog post (get copy and images for Atelier page from Sophie)
- Add a google calendar for Atelier classes + contact email link

Not so much a priority at the moment:

- Link to GivenGain when we have a campaign on there
- Get images with watermarks
- Create dropbox to allow people to give me content
