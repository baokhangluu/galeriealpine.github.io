			We are delighted to share with you a virtual taster of our current winter-spring themed art works by a selection of our artists currently on exhibition at Galerie Alpine. All artists either live locally or have a connection with Villars-sur-Ollon. We believe that we have something for everyone in the gallery – from postcards to high-end artefacts, from representational to abstract interpretations of our inspiring alpine location – a must see and opportunity to acquire contemporary artists’ work.

			<a href="/artists/cat-saunders/">Cat Saunders</a> works with a variety of tinted gold, silver and copper leaf combined with acrylic paint to create her stunning panoramic mountain-scapes. She is happy to capture your chosen views matched with your preferred coloured leaf. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ildze_ose/">Ildze Ose</a> captures the imagination with her large-scale painted illustrations of the local flora and fauna in oils; beautifully painted mountain scenes with deer, cows and flowers are common themes brightening up any wall.

			<a href="/artists/rob-scott/">Rob Scott’s</a> illustrative graphics capture those wonderful nostalgic memories skiing the Grand Chamossaire or relaxing in the sunshine at Chez Jimmy. He is happy to be hired for his graphic design services and his framed posters, prints and cards can be personalised and ordered in various formats. <a href="http://www.cawilliamson.ch">Christine Williamson</a> has a wonderful collection of winter themed, detailed paintings in oils of the local alpine vistas in a variety of sizes. These capture the detail of the local peaks and moments enjoying winter activities in the mountains.

			<a href="/artists/lee-johnson/">Lee Johnson</a> captures the dynamic winter alpine panoramas with his black and white photography, he can often be seen precariously perched with an old camera on or off the pistes. He has stunning large or small formats printed on aluminium, limited edition framed prints and postcards available. Gemma Wiseman’s stylised lino-cut limited edition prints and cards illustrate the ski-lifts, beautiful forest scenes and a variety of local wildlife coming out of hibernation.

			Heena Sheth’s large canvasses are characteristically abstract, playful and colourful exploring the alpine landscape, abstract trees and waterlilies reminiscent of Monet. She usually works in oils, often with a palette knife and is happy to be commissioned to do paintings to match any colour scheme. Eva van Lis also works on a large scale in oils in an abstract style, her current collection of paintings has the common theme of cows. Her work is inspiring and powerful, striking a primitive chord and harmonises beautifully with any chalet interior.

			Our most recent addition to the gallery is the acquisition of <a href="http://www.andrebenoit-art.com">Andre Benoit’s</a> wood assemblage pieces which are often a playful take on wildlife, artists and characters. Each piece is unique - Andre sources reclaimed wood, paints and reconstructs them in fantastic ways. It would also be tempting to invest in any of the exquisite hand-carved limited-edition bronze cast animals, such as the elegant life-sized ibex and horse portraits by our skilled Florentine sculptor <a href="/artists/vincenzo/">Vincenzo Romanelli</a>. If you are feeling creative, then Vincenzo is offering clay modelling workshops in the atelier for adults and children here at Galerie Alpine.
